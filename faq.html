						<strong>Where are you located?</strong>
						<p>
							We are located in Glenesk Commercial Centre, directly across from
							The Hurlers Pub and minutes away from the University of Limerick.
							We are less than 10 minutes drive from the Castletroy/Newport exit
							on the M7. Our offices are located on the first floor and
							accessible via the elevator or stairs on entering the building.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="2">
						<strong>Is there parking available?</strong>
						<p>
							There is free parking available directly in front and to the rear
							of the building.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="3">
						<strong>What does a session entail?</strong>
						<p>
							An initial session will include a thorough history take, followed
							by an assessment consisting of movement patterns and orthopedic
							tests. It is advisable to bring a list of your current
							medications. If treatment is indicated, the treatment will be
							explained to you and your consent to proceed will be obtained.
							Treatment can include guided exercise prescription, massage
							therapies, range of motion exercises and joint manipulation among
							other modalities.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="4">
						<strong>How much do treatments cost?</strong>
						<p>
							Standard one-hour sessions cost €50. Treatments costs may be
							redeemable from your health insurer. The option to pay by card is
							available.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="5">
						<strong>Are treatments cost covered by my Health Insurance?</strong>
						<p>
							Treatment costs are partly redeemable by all major health
							insurers. Rates will depend on your insurance plan so it is
							advisable to check cover with your insurer. If you do not have
							private health insurance, treatment costs are also partially
							redeemable through the ‘MED1’ form available on The Revenue
							website, www.revenue.ie. Treatments are also fully covered under
							the Garda Medical Insurance scheme and ESB Medical.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="6">
						<strong>How many sessions will I need?</strong>
						<p>
							As little as possible! The aim of the session is to equip you with
							knowledge and take-home tools to manage your injury. The reality
							with most musculoskeletal injuries is that 90% of the work that
							needs to be done is to be done by the patient outside of the
							clinical environment. Everyone is different and some injuries
							including some sports injuries/post-op or chronic recurring
							injuries may need more clinic time than more straight forward
							injuries.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="7">
						<strong>What do I wear?</strong>
						<p>
							Wear what you are comfortable in. Non restrictive clothing which
							allows access to assess and treat is ideal. If you have a lower
							body injury, shorts are fine, if you have an upper body injury a
							camisole or string vest top for women is perfect. Sports bras that
							do not open at the back are not suitable.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="8">
						<strong>What does CORU Registered mean?</strong>
						<p>
							CORU is the regulatory body for Health and Social Care
							Professionals in Ireland. The role of this body is to protect the
							public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and
							professional education, training and fitness to practice among
							registrants as per the Health and Social Care Professionals Act
							2005.
