				<blockquote>
					Over the last seven years I have had two back surgeries on the same
					L4/L5 disc. I have been going to Vivienne since December 2016 due to
					back spasm and being in a situation where I could not do any strength
					or physical training without my back going into spasm. Vivienne
					assessed my injury on the first day and gave me confidence that she
					would be able to help me. I haven’t had back spasms in three months
					and I am now running for the first time in seven years. This is all
					down to Vivienne. Her expert knowledge and clear passion for her work
					is evident in her approach.
					<br />
					<br />
					<strong>- Colin O’ Carroll, Limerick</strong>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					I went to see Vivienne for a shoulder injury which Vivienne helped to
					clear up in a matter of weeks. I found Vivienne to be very
					professional, knowledgeable and passionate about her work and put my
					mind at ease from the first session. The exercises that Vivienne
					provided were easy to follow and she was always on hand to answer any
					questions. I would highly recommend Vivienne for helping with any type
					of injury
					<br />
					<br />
					<strong>- Breda Kearney, Limerick</strong>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					I visited Viv a number of times with pain from sports injury. She is a
					true professional and her work on me, together with the exercise plans
					she put together as “home work” really worked in getting me to a pain
					free state. I would highly recommend her as a therapist and she has a
					fantastic knowledge and and a great interest in her clients well
					being.
					<br />
					<br />
					<strong>- Denis Healy, Limerick</strong>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					I had 5/6 treatments with Vivienne for severe shoulder pain. After the
					first treatment I got such relief from the pain I got a full nights
					sleep. I had a few more treatments and she put together a rehab
					exercise programme for me. I was consistent with the exercises at home
					and it paid off. Couldn’t recommend Vivienne enough. She gives her all
					to her clients and is such a caring person.
					<br />
					<br />
					<strong>- Anne Gleeson, Limerick</strong>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					I called Vivienne at very short notice on a Saturday with very severe
					back pain. I found her very professional and really effective with her
					treatment and the ability to make a person relax even in pain. The
					same day I had huge relief and only needed one more treatment to sort
					my pain. Not only did she put me right but is giving me a programme to
					help me for the future. Definitely recommend Vivienne to anyone in
					need of physiotherapy.
					<br />
					<br />
					<strong>- David Kearney, Limerick</strong>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					I was getting headaches and severe pains in my neck, Vivienne put me
					through an excellent program and the difference since is amazing. Feel
					100% better. Can’t thank her enough!
					<br />
					<br />
					<strong>- Declan Dowling, Co. Clare</strong>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Viv is such an amazing and knowledgeable professional. It is
					definitely worth making the trip all the way from Ennis just to be
					treated by her. Highly recommend!
					<br />
					<br />
